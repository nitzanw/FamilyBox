FamilyBox is an Application for managing a family tree. 
Each node in the tree represents a ‘family unit’. you can see this as a ‘private’ network 
that filters, manages and stores all the relevant data for a family. 
this includes birthdays, family reminders, notes, private chat, historical data 
and a full integration with the social networks - such as twitter, facebook, tumblr etc. in a way 
that allows the users to filter family-related data, creating a complete and a close family-like experience.

We are putting a lot of effort into delivering a simple, friendly and elegant UI that provides an attractive enviroment for 
everyone, while fitting for usage by elderly.

First Beta version aims for the app's basic features such as photo sharing, notes sharing and family tree structured networks.

Beta release Deadline due november 7th.
